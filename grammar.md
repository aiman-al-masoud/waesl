# Grammar:
- grammatical relationships are strictly analytic
- compound word morphology can be agglutinating/synthetic
- no articles
- no pronouns
- no possessive pronouns ("tu mi" = "mine, to me, for me")
- any noun can also be a verb and viceversa
- optional verb marker for extra clarity (auxiliary verb "du")
- strict SVO order all the time
- adjectives are always PREmodifiers (like most of english, german, hindi...)
- premodifiers can be stringed up together with the noun (like in german)
- zero-copula whenever possible
- PREpositions, not postpositions
- dative possessive (with "tu" preposition, meaning "to")
