# Phonetics

The language recognizes 23 phonemes (5 vowels + 18 consonants), which is close in absolute number to the [global average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoneme#Numbers_of_phonemes_in_different_languages). The number of distinctions may even be less than that in speech (for example a "p/b", "r/l", "v/f", "i/e", "z/s" and "u/o" mergers may all be possible in speech), but it could make some words unrecognizable in written text. Besides, most people will have to learn to spell the language anyway, so they will learn the full latin alphabet.

The alphabet, [detailed here](./alphabet.psv), only makes use of the basic latin (english) alphabet, and only uses ASCII characters. Double vowels may be used to specify stressed syllables in lieu of accents/diacritics.

The writing system follows the one-letter-to-sound principle. Some phonemes have allophones, for example: there is no distinction between fricatives and affricates.
