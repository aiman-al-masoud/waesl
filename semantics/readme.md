# Semantics 

WAESL is the Worldwide **Extended Semantics** Language, and this means that the semantics ought to be left as wide and fuzzy as possible.

All kinds of semantic associations can be made (take a look at the [lexicon](../lexicon/lexicon.psv) for an idea), words that originally had a specific can be generalized, and words with a general meaning may be used in more specific ways.

This, coupled with the small size of the lexicon (for the moment) should mean that the language will be very much context dependent, the same sentence will have many different interpretations, not unlike [Toki Pona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toki_Pona).

But unlike Toki Pona, WAESL is small only by necessity (there are only so many international words) but it is in principle open to lexical expansion.

Here you can find some [examples of the language](./sentence-examples.md)
