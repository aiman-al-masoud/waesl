# Lexicon

Here you can find the [current offical lexicon](./lexicon.psv), and here some [proposed mess to sort out](./maybe-lexicon.md).

The general idea is that a WAESL word should be: 

1. International
    - used in many major language families (not necessarily all) worldwide.
2. Non-Specialistic
    - **not** exclusively used as technical/scientific jargon; which may be widely used but understood only by specialists or the highly educated classes.


Some interesting linguistic categories to consider for expanding the WAESL dictionary are:

- Globalized loanwords ("yogurt" from Turkish...)
- Cognates ("amen" in many languages)
- Calques ("skyscraper" in some languages)
- Genericized trademarks ("to Google up"...)
- Onomatopoeias ("boom", "bang"...)
- Genericized Proper names ("Adam" for "man/human")
- Organic associations ("mama", "papa")


Some major **contemporary** languages/language families to consider using as "control languages" for adding or removing a word:

- English
- Romance languages (mainly: Spanish, Portuguese, French, Italian)
- Arabic & dialects
- Hindustani & Neo-sanskrit languages
- Mandarin & Chinese languages
- Russian & Slavic languages

Note that not necessarily all control languages should agree on a word all the time, but if a word is only present in English, for instance, even if it's a pretty basic word like: "good", "dog", etc... it should be **RESISTED** and **NOT** added to the WAESL dictionary, because it's not really used across language-family boundaries.

The word "football", on the other hand, is a perfectly fine example of what counts as a globalized English word, it is present (at least as a **calque**) in a number of languages worldwide, and can thus be added to WAESL. It can even be used to "backwards derive" two extra WAESL words: "fut" (foot) and "bol" (ball).

Also note that a WAESL word can trace its origin (etymology) back to any other language that isn't included at all in the aforementioned "control languages" list. The presence of a word in two or more of the control languages is rather to be seen as a "measure of a word's diffusion".
