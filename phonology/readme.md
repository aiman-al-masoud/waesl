# Phonology

The language recognizes a total of 23 phonemes (5 vowels + 18 consonants), which is close in absolute number to the [global average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoneme#Numbers_of_phonemes_in_different_languages). The number of distinctions may even be less than that in speech (for example a "p/b", "r/l", "v/f", "i/e", "z/s" and "u/o" mergers may all be possible in speech), but it could make some words unrecognizable in written text. Besides, most people will have to learn to spell the language anyway.

There are no geminated consonants or vowel quantity.

The alphabet, [detailed here](./alphabet.psv), only makes use of the basic Latin (English) alphabet, and only uses ASCII characters. Double vowels may be used to specify stressed syllables in lieu of accents/diacritics.

The writing system follows a one-letter-to-sound policy, but isn't necessarily one-sound-to-letter in written text. Spelling variations are tolerated. Some phonemes have allophones, for example: fricatives and affricates can be used interchangeably, intervocalic voicing is optional, etc...

Consonant clusters should be avoided as much as possible.
